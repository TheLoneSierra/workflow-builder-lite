# About Me

Hi, I’m Aanchal Pal.

I’m a software engineer with experience in building full-stack web applications using React, Node.js, MongoDB and LLMs.

I enjoy designing structured backend systems, building modular architectures, and working with LLM-powered applications.

This project demonstrates:
- Clean API design
- Sequential workflow execution
- LLM integration
- Persistent run history
- Health monitoring endpoints
